### Project Title
Github Bikeshare Project

### Description
This is the final project for the Programming for Data Science Nanodegree and uses a previous project exploring US Bikeshare data to test proficiency with Github. The US Bikeshare project utilizes python to ask for user inputs to explore bikeshare usage in one of three cities (NYC, Washington DC, Chicago) from data taken from the first half of 2017.

Example of Use:
Begin by running "python bikeshare.py" and the user will be prompted for city, month, and day:
  -Valid cities are "Washington", "New York City", and "Chicago" (user must select 1)
  -Valid months are "January" through "June" (user may select 1 or "all")
  -Valid days are all days of the week (e.g. "Monday", "Tuesday"... user may select 1 or "all")
More detailed information can be found within bikeshare.py

### Files used
bikeshare.py: main project file; requests user input on which city and date range to review
<city>.csv: bikeshare datasets with the city name corresponding to the name of the file (in .gitignore)

### Credits
Credit to the makers of the Udacity course for the template in creating the template for the python file and the overall course!
