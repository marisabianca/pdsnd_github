### Project Title
Github Bikeshare Project

### Description
This is the final project for the Programming for Data Science Nanodegree and uses a previous project exploring US Bikeshare data to test proficiency with Github. The US Bikeshare project utilizes python to ask for user inputs to explore bikeshare usage in one of three cities (NYC, Washington DC, Chicago) from data taken from the first half of 2017.

### Files used
bikeshare.py: main project file; requests user input on which city and date range to review
<city>.csv: bikeshare datasets with the city name corresponding to the name of the file (in .gitignore)

### Credits
Credit to the makers of the Udacity course for the template in creating the template for the python file and the overall course!
